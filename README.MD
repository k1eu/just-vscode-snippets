# Just Snippets for vscode

This is a monorepo for the `Just * snippets` series of snippet extensions. Extensions can be found on the vscode Marketplace.

// TODO: Add links

## History

Ofc inspiration and many of the snippets are from the OG [ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets). But for me personally there are way too many snippets and new additions which doesn't work with my Keep It Simple approach in vscode.
